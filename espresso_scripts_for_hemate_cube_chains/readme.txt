In this folder ESPRESSO scripts for hematite cube equalibrium configurations calculations chain alignment in external magnetic field are presented


The scripts lowH_slim.py and highH_slim.py calculete chain orientation distribution for 4cube hematite chains at magnetic fields below and abowe crytical value. Sripts are optimised not to sgow any graphical output.

Scripts 2d_46.py and 2d_92_no_gravity.py calculate 2d equalibrium configurations using 46 and 92 sphere approximation for superball.
Script 3d_46_no_gravity.py and 2d_46_gravity.py calculete equallibrium configuretions in the case when there is no gravity amd in the case when gravity effects are taken into account explicetely.
